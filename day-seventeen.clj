;; Dijkstra's

;; 1. Mark all nodes as unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called
;; the unvisited set.

;; 2. Assign to every node a distance from start value: for the starting node, it
;; is zero, and for all other nodes, it is infinity, since initially no path is
;; known to these nodes. During execution of the algorithm, the distance of a
;; node N is the length of the shortest path discovered so far between the
;; starting node and N.[17]

;; 3. From the unvisited set, select the current node to be the one with the
;; smallest finite distance; initially, this will be the starting node, which
;; has distance zero. If the unvisited set is empty, or contains only nodes with
;; infinite distance (which are unreachable), then the algorithm terminates by
;; going to step 6. If we are only concerned about the path to a target node, we
;; may terminate here if the current node is the target node. Otherwise, we can
;; continue to find the shortest paths to all reachable nodes.

;; 4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and update
;; their distances through the current node; compare the newly calculated
;; distance to the one currently assigned to the neighbor and assign it the
;; smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of
;; 6, and the edge connecting it with its neighbor B has length 2, then the
;; distance to B through A is 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a
;; distance greater than 8, then update it to 8 (the path to B through A is
;; shorter). Otherwise, keep its current distance (the path to B through A is
;; not the shortest).

;; 5. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current
;; node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.
;; This is so that a visited node is never checked again, which is correct
;; because the distance recorded on the current node is minimal (as ensured in
;; step 3), and thus final. Go back to step 3.

;; 6. Once the loop exits (steps 3â€“5), every visited node will contain its shortest
;; distance from the starting node.
